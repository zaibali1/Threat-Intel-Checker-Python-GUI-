🛡️ Threat Intel Feed Checker
A Python GUI application that analyzes IP addresses and URLs using VirusTotal and AbuseIPDB threat intelligence APIs. It flags malicious inputs, displays the results in a real-time dashboard, and generates a local CSV report. The app includes an interactive chart to monitor API request patterns.

- 🦠 [VirusTotal API](https://www.virustotal.com/)
- 🚨 [AbuseIPDB API](https://www.abuseipdb.com/)


📌 Features
🔍 Analyze IP addresses and URLs manually or via file upload.
- ✅ Check IPs and URLs via VirusTotal
- ✅ Check IPs via AbuseIPDB
- 📂 File upload (.txt/.csv)
- 🖼️ Tkinter-based GUI — no CLI needed
- 💾 Save results to CSV
- 🔔 Alert if any indicator is flagged as malicious


💻 Installation
🔧 Requirements
Python 3.8+

⚙️ Install Required Package:

|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **requests**  | To send HTTP requests to APIs (VirusTotal & AbuseIPDB)                  |
| **pandas**    | To handle and structure results in table format and export to CSV       |
| **tkinter**   | To build the graphical user interface (buttons, text areas, tables)     |
| **ttk**       | `tkinter.ttk` provides improved widgets like `Treeview` for tables      |
| **messagebox**| For showing alerts like "Analysis complete" or error messages           |
| **filedialog**| For file upload UI functionality (CSV or TXT)  


🧠 Integrates:
VirusTotal API
AbuseIPDB API

🔐 API Keys Setup
🧪 VirusTotal
Sign up: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us
Get your API key from your profile
Replace in threat_checker.py:
VT_API_KEY = 'your_virustotal_api_key'


🚨 AbuseIPDB
Sign up: https://www.abuseipdb.com/register
Get your API key from: https://www.abuseipdb.com/account/api
Replace in threat_checker.py:
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY = 'your_abuseipdb_api_key'


⚠️ Flags malicious IPs/URLs based on:
VirusTotal: if VT_Malicious > 0
AbuseIPDB: if Abuse_Confidence ≥ 50



📂 Saves results to a CSV at C:\Users\Zaib Ali\Desktop\project\threat_report.csv
📊 Displays an API usage graph (mocked for UI enhancement)
⚠️ Shows alert popups if malicious indicators are detected
🖥️ Built with Tkinter and Matplotlib



🚀 Usage
✅ Option 1: Manual Entry
Type one IP or URL per line

Click Analyze Input

✅ Option 2: Upload File
Supported formats: .txt, .csv

First column of CSV is used

## 💾 Output Table Format

After scanning, results are shown in a table and saved as `threat_report.csv`:

| Column Name         | Description                                                                 |

| `VT_Harmless`       | Number of VirusTotal engines that marked it as harmless                     |
| `VT_Malicious`      | Number of VirusTotal engines that flagged it as malicious                   |
| `VT_Suspicious`     | Number of VirusTotal engines that marked it as suspicious                   |
| `VT_Undetected`     | Number of engines that didn't detect it as malicious                        |
| `Abuse_Confidence`  | AbuseIPDB’s abuse confidence score (0–100) for IP addresses                 |
| `Total_Reports`     | Number of abuse reports submitted to AbuseIPDB for this IP                  |
| `Country`           | Country code where the IP is geolocated (via AbuseIPDB)                     |

📁 Example saved CSV file: `threat_report.csv`
